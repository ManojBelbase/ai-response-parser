Huge ecosystem and beginner-friendly.\n*   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Essential for frontend web development (React, Angular, Vue), Node.js backends, and increasingly for mobile with React Native. TypeScript adds strong typing for large projects.\n*   **Go:** Ideal for cloud-native development, microservices, and high-performance networking. Known for its speed and concurrency features.\n*   **Rust:** Gaining popularity for systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. Offers memory safety and concurrency without a garbage collector.\n*   **C#:** Strong choice for enterprise applications, game development (Unity), and Windows development. Part of the .NET ecosystem.\n\nWhich of these languages are you most interested in learning more about, or what type of project do you have in mind? I can provide more specific guidance and code examples!\n"

    const response2 = "Okay, I can definitely help you with that! Here's how to determine if a year is a leap year in 12 popular programming languages, along with explanations and best practices.  After each example, I'll offer to show you how to implement this in a larger project.\n\n**Leap Year Logic:**\n\nA year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, unless it's also divisible by 100. If it's divisible by 100, it's *only* a leap year if it's also divisible by 400.\n\nHere's the leap year check in each language:\n\n**1. JavaScript**\n\n```javascript\nfunction isLeapYear(year) {\n  return (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0);\n}\n\nconsole.log(isLeapYear(2024)); // true\nconsole.log(isLeapYear(1900)); // false\nconsole.log(isLeapYear(2000)); // true\n```\n\n**2. Python**\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n  return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)\n\nprint(is_leap_year(2024)) # True\nprint(is_leap_year(1900)) # False\nprint(is_leap_year(2000)) # True\n```\n\n**3. Java**\n\n```java\nclass Main {\n  public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {\n    return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(isLeapYear(2024)); // true\n    System.out.println(isLeapYear(1900)); // false\n    System.out.println(isLeapYear(2000)); // true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**4. C#**\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class Program {\n  public static bool IsLeapYear(int year) {\n    return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);\n  }\n\n  public static void Main(string[] args) {\n    Console.WriteLine(IsLeapYear(2024)); // True\n    Console.WriteLine(IsLeapYear(1900)); // False\n    Console.WriteLine(IsLeapYear(2000)); // True\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**5. C++**\n\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n\nbool isLeapYear(int year) {\n  return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);\n}\n\nint main() {\n  std::cout << isLeapYear(2024) << std::endl; // true\n  std::cout << isLeapYear(1900) << std::endl; // false\n  std::cout << isLeapYear(2000) << std::endl; // true\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**6. Go**\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc isLeapYear(year int) bool {\n  return (year%4 == 0 && year%100 != 0) || (year%400 == 0)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  fmt.Println(isLeapYear(2024)) // true\n  fmt.Println(isLeapYear(1900)) // false\n  fmt.Println(isLeapYear(2000)) // true\n}\n```\n\n**7. Rust**\n\n```rust\nfn is_leap_year(year: i32) -> bool {\n  (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  println!(\"{}\", is_leap_year(2024)); // true\n  println!(\"{}\", is_leap_year(1900)); // false\n  println!(\"{}\", is_leap_year(2000)); // true\n}\n```\n\n**8. PHP**\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction isLeapYear(int $year): bool {\n  return ($year % 4 === 0 && $year % 100 !== 0) || ($year % 400 === 0);\n}\n\necho isLeapYear(2024) ? 'true' : 'false'; // true\necho \"\\n\";\necho isLeapYear(1900) ? 'false' : 'true'; // false\necho \"\\n\";\necho isLeapYear(2000) ? 'true' : 'false'; // true\necho \"\\n\";\n?>\n```\n\n**9. Swift**\n\n```swift\nfunc isLeapYear(year: Int) -> Bool {\n  return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)\n}\n\nprint(isLeapYear(year: 2024)) // true\nprint(isLeapYear(year: 1900)) // false\nprint(isLeapYear(year: 2000)) // true\n```\n\n**10. Kotlin**\n\n```kotlin\nfun isLeapYear(year: Int): Boolean {\n  return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n  println(isLeapYear(2024)) // true\n  println(isLeapYear(1900)) // false\n  println(isLeapYear(2000)) // true\n}\n```\n\n**11. Ruby**\n\n```ruby\ndef is_leap_year(year)\n  (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)\nend\n\nputs is_leap_year(2024) # true\nputs is_leap_year(1900) # false\nputs is_leap_year(2000) # true\n```\n\n**12. Scala**\n\n```scala\nobject Main {\n  def isLeapYear(year: Int): Boolean = {\n    (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    println(isLeapYear(2024)) // true\n    println(isLeapYear(1900)) // false\n    println(isLeapYear(2000)) // true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Best Practices & Improvements:**\n\n*   **Clear Function/Method Names:**  Use descriptive names like `isLeapYear` to improve code readability.\n*   **Modularity:**  Encapsulate the leap year logic within a function or method to promote reusability.\n*   **Type Safety:** Use type hints (where available, like in Python, PHP, TypeScript) to make the code more robust.\n*   **Testing:**  Write unit tests to ensure the function behaves correctly for various inputs (e.g., divisible by 4, 100, 400, and not divisible by any of them).\n\nWould you like me to show you how to integrate this leap year check into a larger project (e.g., a date validation library, a calendar application, or something else)?  Just let me know which language you're interested in and what kind of project you have in mind, and I can provide an example.\n"



    const res = "```ruby\ndef factorial(n)\n  if n == 0\n    1\n  else\n    n * factorial(n-1)\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 5\nresult = factorial(number)\nputs \"The factorial of #{number} is #{result}\" # Output: The factorial of 5 is 120\n\n# Iterative approach (more efficient for large numbers):\ndef factorial_iterative(n)\n  result = 1\n  (1..n).each do |i|\n    result *= i\n  end\n  result\nend\n\nnumber = 6\nresult = factorial_iterative(number)\nputs \"The factorial of #{number} (iterative) is #{result}\" # Output: The factorial of 6 (iterative) is 720\n\n# Handle negative input using exceptions\ndef factorial_safe(n)\n    raise ArgumentError, \"Input must be a non-negative integer\" if n < 0\n    if n == 0\n        1\n    else\n        n * factorial_safe(n-1)\n    end\nrescue ArgumentError => e\n    puts \"Error: #{e.message}\"\n    nil  # Or raise the exception, depending on your needs\nend\n\nputs factorial_safe(-1) # Output: Error: Input must be a non-negative integer\n```\n\n**Explanation and Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Recursive Approach:** The first `factorial(n)` function demonstrates the classic recursive way to calculate the factorial. It's concise but can lead to stack overflow errors for large input values.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach:** The `factorial_iterative(n)` function provides an iterative solution. This is generally more efficient, especially for larger numbers, as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.  This is the recommended way to calculate factorials in most practical scenarios.\n\n3. **Error Handling:** The `factorial_safe(n)` adds error handling to prevent issues when a negative number is passed as an argument.  It raises an `ArgumentError` which can be caught and handled.  This is crucial for robust code.  Always validate input!\n\n4. **Example Usage:**  The code provides clear examples of how to use both functions and prints the results to the console.\n\n**Which approach to use?**\n\n*   For small values of `n` (less than, say, 10), the recursive approach is fine for demonstration and clarity.\n*   For any practical use case where performance and avoiding stack overflow are concerns, use the iterative approach.\n*   Always add error handling, especially if the input is coming from an external source (user input, a file, etc.).\n\nDo you want to explore implementing this in other languages, or discuss alternative approaches (like memoization for the recursive approach)?  Or perhaps you want to understand the Big O notation of each approach?  Let me know what you'd like to do next!\n"
